Title: Transition probabilities
Authors: RenÃ© Schmiedler
Date: 20.08.2021

Description 
-----------
This file allows the user to calculate transition probabilities of bins of data points stored 
in a collection of segregation matrices that represent a number of realizations of a 
particular sequence. It can be imported as a module.

Requirements
------------
* numpy

Functions
---------
* bin_probs  - slices entries of a stack of segregation matrices into a number of col bins 
                that are then given to func alc_probs according to pairwise combinations of 
                sequence elemements where transition probabilities are calculated and returned.
* calc_probs - computes all element-wise differences of all pairs and the corresponding transition 
                probabilities using a degree matrix.

    """
    This function slices entries of a stack of segregation matrices into a number of col bins 
    that are then given to func calc_probs according to pairwise combinations of sequence 
    elemements where transition probabilities are calculated and returned.
    
    The number of columns of a segregation matrix (i.e number of data points) must be evenly
    devidable by the number of bins desired, otherwise the script is terminated.
    The comb_vect stores all possible combinations of sequence elements such that none appear
    multiple times so that the computational cost is reduced.

    Arguments
    ---------
    seg_mat : numpy array
        collection of segregation matrices (realizations; order of series of no import)
    sequence : numpy vector
        the sequence in which the realizations stored in seg_mat are visited
    n_bin : int
        user defined number of bins for each realization
    hist_len : int
        maximum history length from which entropy is measured to be transferred between time series

    Return
    ------
    tprob_all : numpy array
        the probabilities of all bins to transition to other bins in any step of the sequence
        as calculated by calc_probs
