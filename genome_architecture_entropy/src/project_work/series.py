Description 
-----------
This file allows the user to generate a configuration space using a series of realizations with a
start and end state between which a weighted mean and noise are applied.
It can be imported as a module.

Requires
--------
* numpy
* shapely

Functions
---------
* series_conf_space - generates an ensemble of specified length between a given star and end state
* generate_series   - computes a series of states according to transition probabilities

    Computes a series of states according to transition probabilities.
    
    This function evaluates the similarity of all pairs of states and calculates a normalized 
    distance. A random walk of a time-homogenous markov chain in a finite state space is 
    computed (= a series of realizations) according to transition probabilities derived from 
    the distance measure.

    prnt : bool, optional
